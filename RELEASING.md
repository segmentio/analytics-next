## Releasing

### Feature branches

Feature branches are automatically released under:

- `http://cdn.segment.com/analytics-next/br/<branch>/<latest|sha>/standalone.js.gz`

### Production

To test what the changelog will look like beforehand (locally), you can do `yarn version`. Once you have tested your changes and they have been approved for a new release, merge the changeset pull request into master.
