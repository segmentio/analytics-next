### Plugin Types Explanation
[This information is also available in the Segment documentation](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#plugins-and-source-middleware)

- **Source Middleware** (see [Example](#example-source-middleware-implementation))
  - **Source Middleware is just a light API wrapper around a "Before" type plugin Plugin**
  - Source Middleware is the legacy API (pre-analytics next). It's less verbose than the full plugin API, but a bit less powerful. It is functionally equivalent to a "Before" type plugin.
  
- **Before Plugins** (see [Example](#example-plugin-implementation))
  - Run before any other plugins
  - Critical priority - block event pipeline until `.load()` resolves
  - Use cases: Event validation, data transformation
  - Example: Event validation before passing to other plugins)


- **Enrichment Plugins**
  - Functionally Identitical to "before" plugins, but run after them. Before plugins are typically used internally (e.g adding page info), but there's no hard and fast rule.

- **Destination Plugins**
  - Run after enrichment
  - Cannot modify the event
  - Execute in parallel
  - Failures do not halt pipeline
  - Example: Segment.io, Google Analytics, Mixpanel

- **After Plugins (uncommon)**
  - Run after all other plugins complete
  - Use cases: Metrics, logging
  - Example: segment.io plugin for observability metrics

- **Utility Plugins**
  - Executes only once during the analytics.js bootstrap. Gives you access to the analytics instance using the plugin's load() method. This doesn't allow you to modify events.
  - Do not directly process events
  - Example: some plugin that registers a bunch of analytics event listeners (e.g. analytics.on('track', ...) and reports them to an external system)
  
- **Add Destination Middleware** (See [Example](#example-destination-middleware-implementation))
  - A special type of plugin that allows you to add a plugin that only affects a specific (device mode) destination plugin.


### Example: Plugin Implementation
```ts
analytics.register({
  name: 'My Plugin',
  type: 'before',
  isLoaded: () => true,
  load: () => Promise.resolve(),
  // lowercase all track event names
  track: (ctx) => {
    ctx.event.event = ctx.event.event.toLowerCase()
    return ctx
  },
  // drop page events with a specific title
  page: (ctx) => {
    if (ctx.properties.title === 'some title') {
      return null 
    }
  }
})
``` 
### Example: Source Middleware Implementation
```ts
analytics.addSourceMiddleware(({ payload, next }) => {
  const { event } = payload.obj.context
  if (event.type === 'track') {
    // change the event name to lowercase
    event.event = event.event.toLowerCase()
  } else if (event.type === 'page') {
    // drop any page events with a specific title
    if (event.properties.title === 'some title') {
      return null
    }
}
  next(payload) 
})
```

### Example: Destination Middleware Implementation
> [!NOTE]
> It is not currently possible to add a destination middleware JUST to the segment.io destination plugin.
```ts
analytics.addDestinationMiddleware('amplitude', ({ next, payload }) => {
  payload.obj.properties!.hello = 'from the other side'
  next(payload)
})
```
or, to apply to all destinations
```ts
analytics.addDestinationMiddleware('*', (ctx) => {
  ctx.event.properties!.hello = 'from the other side'
  return ctx
})
```

### Event Flow Example

When `analytics.track()` is called:

1. Event is created via Event Factory
2. Event enters the queue
3. Before plugins validate/transform
4. Enrichment plugins add data in parallel
5. Destination plugins receive the event in parallel (including Segment.io plugin)
6. Any after plugins handle post-processing (e.g. metrics collection)

### Plugin Priorities

- **Critical Plugins**: Must be loaded before event delivery starts
  - Example: Before plugins, Validation plugins
- **Non-Critical Plugins**: Can load after event delivery begins
  - Example: Destination plugins
