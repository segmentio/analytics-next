### Analytics.js Initialization Flow
The following diagram illustrates how Analytics.js initializes and loads device mode destinations:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Page as Web Page
    participant AJS as Analytics.js
    participant CDN as Segment CDN
    participant Dest as Device Mode Destinations

    Note over Page,Dest: Initialization Phase
    Page->>AJS: Load analytics.js<br/>with writeKey
    AJS->>CDN: Fetch settings
    CDN-->>AJS: Return CDN settings
    
    Note over AJS: Block events unil all non-destination plugins and middleware are loaded
    
    Note over AJS: Parse device mode<br/>destinations
    
    Note over AJS,Dest: Begin parallel destination loading
    par Parallel Destination Loading
        AJS->>Dest: Load destination 1<br/>(async)
        AJS->>Dest: Load destination 2<br/>(async)
    end

    Note over AJS,Dest: Each destination loads its own scripts
    
    Note over AJS: If critical plugins exist,<br/>wait for their registration

    par Event Delivery (per destination)
        AJS->>Dest: Flush buffered events to segment.io
        AJS->>Dest: Flush buffered events to dest 1
        AJS->>Dest: Flush buffered events to dest 2
    end

```

Key Points:
- Analytics.js is loaded with a writeKey that identifies your Segment source
- CDN settings are fetched containing destination configurations
- Event queue is blocked until all non-destination plugins and middleware are registered 
- Each destination may load its own third-party scripts
- Critical plugins (if any) must complete registration before event delivery
- Buffered events are flushed to destinations in parallel once they're ready

### Plugin Types and Middleware
[This information is also available in the Segment documentation](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#plugins-and-source-middleware)

- **Source Middleware** (see [Example](#example-source-middleware-implementation))
  - **Source Middleware is just a light API wrapper around a "Before" type plugin Plugin**
  - Source Middleware is the legacy API (pre-analytics next). It's less verbose than the full plugin API, but a bit less powerful. It is functionally equivalent to a "Before" type plugin.
  
- **Before Plugins** (see [Example](#example-plugin-implementation))
  - Run before any other plugins
  - Critical priority - block event pipeline until `.load()` resolves
  - Use cases: Event validation, data transformation
  - Example: Event validation before passing to other plugins)


- **Enrichment Plugins**
  - Functionally Identitical to "before" plugins, but run after them. Before plugins are typically used internally (e.g adding page info), but there's no hard and fast rule.

- **Destination Plugins**
  - Run after enrichment
  - Cannot modify the event
  - Execute in parallel
  - Failures do not halt pipeline
  - Example: Segment.io, Google Analytics, Mixpanel

- **After Plugins (uncommon)**
  - Run after all other plugins complete
  - Use cases: Metrics, logging
  - Example: segment.io plugin for observability metrics

- **Utility Plugins**
  - Executes only once during the analytics.js bootstrap. Gives you access to the analytics instance using the plugin's load() method. This doesn't allow you to modify events.
  - Do not directly process events
  - Example: some plugin that registers a bunch of analytics event listeners (e.g. analytics.on('track', ...) and reports them to an external system)
  
- **Destination Middleware** (See [Example](#example-destination-middleware-implementation))
  - A special type of plugin that allows you to add a plugin that only affects a specific (device mode) destination plugin.


### Example: Plugin Implementation
```ts
analytics.register({
  name: 'My Plugin',
  type: 'before',
  isLoaded: () => true,
  load: () => Promise.resolve(),
  // lowercase all track event names
  track: (ctx) => {
    ctx.event.event = ctx.event.event.toLowerCase()
    return ctx
  },
  // drop page events with a specific title
  page: (ctx) => {
    if (ctx.properties.title === 'some title') {
      return null 
    }
    return ctx
  }
})
``` 
### Example: Source Middleware Implementation
```ts
analytics.addSourceMiddleware(({ payload, next }) => {
  const { event } = payload.obj.context
  if (event.type === 'track') {
    // change the event name to lowercase
    event.event = event.event.toLowerCase()
  } else if (event.type === 'page') {
    // drop any page events with a specific title
    if (event.properties.title === 'some title') {
      return null
    }
}
  next(payload) 
})
```

### Example: Destination Middleware Implementation
> [!NOTE]
> It is not currently possible to add a destination middleware to the Segment.io destination.
```ts
analytics.addDestinationMiddleware('amplitude', ({ next, payload }) => {
  payload.obj.properties!.hello = 'from the other side'
  next(payload)
})
```
or, to apply to all destinations
```ts
analytics.addDestinationMiddleware('*', (ctx) => {
  // This does not apply to the segment.io destination plugin, only device mode destinations.
  ctx.event.properties!.hello = 'from the other side'
  return ctx
})
```


### Event Flow Example

When `analytics.track()` is called:

1. Event is created via Event Factory
2. Event enters the queue
3. Before plugins run, in order of registration
3. Enrichment plugins run, in order of registration
4. Destination plugins receive the event in parallel (including Segment.io plugin)
5. Any after plugins handle post-processing (e.g. metrics collection)

### Plugin Priorities

- **Critical Plugins**: Must be loaded before event delivery starts
  - Example: Before plugins, Validation plugins
- **Non-Critical Plugins**: Can load after event delivery begins
  - Example: Destination plugins
